#DEFININITION FROM https://www.simplypsychology.org/stroop-effect.html
The Stroop Effect is a famous psychology experiment first studied by J.R. Stroop in the 1930s. It shows that people find it easier to name 
the color of a word when the word matches the color it’s printed in. For example, the word “red” written in red ink.
But when the word and the ink color don’t match – like the word “red” written in green ink – it takes longer to say the correct color.
This happens because reading words is automatic, and it interferes with the task of naming the ink color.

#STROOP EFFECT SIMULATION
This project was created to simulate the Stroop Effect but instead of using human participants it utilises the computational model Drift Difusion Model (DDM). It is used to model reaction times and error rates for congruent and incogruent trials.
