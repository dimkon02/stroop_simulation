#HYPOTHESIS

STROOP INTEFEREANCE HYPOTHESIS
    1. We expect that incongruent trials will produce longer reaction times and larger error rates compared to congruent trials.
    2. Increasing the word weight should increase the reaction times and error rates in incongruent trials, while it should simutaneously
       have minimal effect in congruent trials.     
    3. Inconcgruent trials, should produce borader and more right skewed reaction time distiributions than those in congruent trials.


#ANALYZING RESULTS
    1. As we can see from the results, the incongruent trials have longer reaction times and higher error rate compared to congruent trials.
    2. As we can see from the two plots named (Mean_Reaction_VS_Word_Weight and Error_Rate_VS_Word_Weight) when the word weight increases 
       incongruent trials are affected the most with both reaction time and error rate increasing dramatically, while in congruent trials
       the values stay very similar, with reaction time getting better as the word weight increases.
    3. As we can see from the histogram for every incongruent trial the results are far broader and more right skewed than those in 
       congruent trials.

#FINAL VERDICT
    The Stroop Effect Simulation produced the empirical Stroop effect findings. Congruent trials have faster reaction time with lower error 
rate and narrower distributions, while Incongruent trials produce the oppsite slower reaction times, higher error rates and broader 
distributions.
